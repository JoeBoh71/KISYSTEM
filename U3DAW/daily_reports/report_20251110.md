# U3DAW Daily Report - 2025-11-10

## Tasks Completed Today
- Task 1.1: Linkwitz-Riley Filters (SearchAgent + MathAgent + CodeAgent)
- Task 1.2: cuFFT Wrapper (CodeAgent)
- Task 1.3: Overlap-Save Algorithm (CodeAgent)
- Task 1.4: Unit Tests Setup (TestAgent)

## Files Created
1. docs/research/linkwitz_riley_theory.md
2. src/tep/pqmf/filter_coefficients.json
3. src/tep/pqmf/linkwitz_riley.h
4. src/tep/pqmf/cufft_wrapper.h
5. src/tep/pqmf/overlap_save.h
6. tests/unit/test_main.cpp
7. tests/unit/test_filters.cpp
8. tests/CMakeLists.txt

## Metrics
- Tasks Completed: 4/4 (100% of Week 1 goals!)
- Status: ON TRACK
- Next Week: Tasks 1.5-1.8 (TEP Operators)

## Learning Log Entries
1. LR-4 = Butterworth squared (frequency-domain optimal)
2. cuFFT RAII wrapper prevents memory leaks
3. Overlap-Save 75% eliminates artifacts
4. Google Test FetchContent = zero manual setup

## Next Steps
1. Compile project with Visual Studio 2022 + CUDA Toolkit
2. Run unit tests (expect placeholders to pass)
3. Begin Task 1.5: Amplitude Gain Operator
4. Performance benchmarking (target: <0.5ms per filter)
